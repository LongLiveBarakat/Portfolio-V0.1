          <h1>Curious about me? Here you have it:</h1>
          <p>
            I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed developer who specializes in front
            end development (React.js & Vue.js). I am very enthusiastic about
            bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to
            life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear,
            readable, highly performant code matters to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my journey as a front end developer in 2022, and since then,
            I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
            challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now,
            in my early thirties, 2 years after starting my web development
            journey, I'm building cutting-edge web applications using modern
            technologies such as React.js, Javascript, Vue.js, Tailwindcss,
            Supabase and much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
            end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me learing new
            technologies, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying
            some free time. You can follow me on Linkedin where I share my
            experiences and journies, or you can follow me on GitHub.
          </p>
